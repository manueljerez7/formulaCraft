# Formula Craft

## “Land, Craft, Race, Win!”

Project made for the 2021/2022 edition of the course Videogame Design and Programming, Politecnico Milano

The basis of our game is really simple, but also one of the facts that makes it really unique:
In this game, when you start the race you don’t have a vehicle to compete in.
First, you will have to find and get some wheels, chassis, and other parts to build your car.
After that, you will have to assemble them, and then try to be the first in getting to the finish line.
That is why the game does not only include a racing experience, but also the need to explore the map when you start the game to get the pieces to get your vehicle as soon as possible.
